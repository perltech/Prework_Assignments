	<h2>Bio</h2>
		<p>
			Man or Astro-man is a surf rock band from Auburn, Alabama, that was formed in 1992. They've released a plethora of music since then, and are still around today.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main members of the band are Star Crunch (aka Brian Causey) on guitar and sometimes vocals, Birdstuff (aka Brian Teasley) on drums, and Coco the Electronic Monkey Wizard (Robert DelBueno) on bass guitar and electronics.
		</p>
		<p>
			Man or Astro-man? was one of the most prolific punk bands of the 1990s, recording 10 albums between 1993 and 2001. When the band was not in the recording studio, they were usually on the road, gigging almost constantly. Their live shows were notable for their sci-fi theatrics: all members of the band dressed in space age jumpsuits, and often included elaborate sci-fi set pieces.
